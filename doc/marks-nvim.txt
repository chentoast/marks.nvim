==============================================================================
1. Introduction                                            *marks-introduction*

This plugin enhances vim's built in marks functionality. Among other things,
it allows you to:

  view marks in the sign column
  quikcly add, delete, and toggle marks
  cycle between marks
  preview marks in floating windows
  extract marks to quickfix/location list
  place bookmarks with sign/virtual text annotations

This plugin requires neovim 0.5 or higher. Since this plugin is mainly written
in lua, it will not work with vim.

==============================================================================
2. Setup                                                        *marks-setup*

Setup is done through lua. To initialize the plugin with all of its defaults,
put the following in your init.vim:

  Example: >

      require'marks'.setup {
        default_mappings = true,
        signs = true,
        mappings = {}
      }
<
The setup function takes in a table of keys that control the behavior of this
plugin. The following options are defined:

                                                               *marks-builtin*
  builtin_marks: table
    (default {})

    Which builtin marks to track and show. If set, these marks will also show
    up in the signcolumn and will update on |CursorMoved|

    Supported values:
      "'"
      "^"
      "."
      "<"
      ">"

    Example: >

      require'marks'.setup {
        builtin_marks = { "'", "<", ">", "." }
      }
<
                                                      *marks-default_mappings*
  default_mappings: bool
    (default true)

    Whether to use the default plugin mappings or not. See |marks-mappings| for more

                                                                 *marks-signs*
  signs: bool
    (default true)

    Whether to show marks in the signcolumn or not. If set to true, its
    recommended to also set |signcolumn| to "auto", for cases where multiple
    marks are placed on the same line.

                                                                *marks-cyclic*
  cyclic: bool
    (default true)

    Whether forward/backwards movement should cycle back to the beginning/end
    of buffer.

                                                     *marks-force_write_shada*
  force_write_shada: bool
    (default false)

    If true, then deleting global (uppercase) marks will also update the
    |shada| file accordingly and force deletion of the mark permanently.
    This option can be destructive and should be set only after reading more
    about the shada file.

                                                      *marks-refresh_interval*
  refresh_interval: integer
    (default 150)

    How often (in ms) marks.nvim should update the marks list and recompute
    mark positions/redraw signs. Lower values means that mark positions and
    signs will refresh much quicker, but may incur a higher performance
    penalty, whereas higher values may result in better performance, but may
    also cause noticable lag in signs updating.

                                                         *marks-sign_priority*
  sign_priority: integer | table
    (default 10)

    The sign priority to be used for marks. Can either be a number, in which
    case the priority applies to all types of marks, or a table with some or
    all of the following keys:

      lower: sign priority for lowercase marks
      upper: sign priority for uppercase marks
      builtin: sign priority for builtin marks
      bookmark: sign priority for bookmarks

  excluded_filetypes: table                         *marks-excluded_filetypes*
    (default {})

    Which filetypes to ignore. If a buffer with this filetype is opened, then
    marks.nvim will not track any marks set in this buffer, and will not
    display any signs. Setting and moving to marks with ` or ' will still work, but
    movement commands like "m]" or "m[" will not.

  excluded_buftypes: table                         *marks-excluded_buftypes*
    (default {})

    Which buftypes to ignore. If a buffer with this buftype is opened, then
    marks.nvim will not track any marks set in this buffer, and will not
    display any signs. Setting and moving to marks with ` or ' will still work, but
    movement commands like "m]" or "m[" will not.

  bookmark_[0-9]: table                              *marks-bookmark_config*
    (default {})

    Configuration table for each bookmark group (see |marks-bookmarks|).
    The table has the following keys:

      sign: the character to use in the signcolumn for this bookmark group.
        defaults to "!@#$%^&*()" - in order from group 1 to 0. set to false to
        turn off signs for this bookmark.
      virt_text: virtual text annotations to place at the eol of a bookmark.
        defaults to nil, meaning no virtual text.
      annotate: when true, explicitly prompts the user for an annotation that
        will be displayed above the bookmark. defaults to false.

==============================================================================
2. Bookmarks                                                *marks-bookmarks*

marks.nvim also introduces the idea of a "bookmark" - a unnamed marker that is
tied to a particular (buffer, line, col) triple. Bookmarks can optionally have
signs or virtual text annotations attached to them, and can be useful for
remembering positions in a particular buffer without having to set an
uppercase mark. For example, you might set two bookmarks to quickly toggle
back and forth between a function and its corresponding unit test in another file.

marks.nvim supports up to 10 bookmark groups, each of which optionally has its
own sign text and virtual text. marks.nvim provides functionality to set,
delete, and cycle between bookmarks of a particular group - see
|marks-mappings| for more information.

==============================================================================
2. Mappings                                                   *marks-mappings*

The following mappings are defined by default:

    mx              Set mark x
    m,              Set the next available alphabetical (lowercase) mark
    m;              Toggle the next available mark at the current line
    dmx             Delete mark x
    dm-             Delete all marks on the current line
    dm<space>       Delete all marks in the current buffer
    m]              Move to next mark
    m[              Move to previous mark
    m:              Preview mark. This will prompt you for a specific mark to
                    preview; press <cr> to preview the next mark.
    m[0-9]          Add a bookmark from bookmark group[0-9].
    dm[0-9]         Delete all bookmarks from bookmark group[0-9].
    m}              Move to the next bookmark having the same type as the bookmark under
                    the cursor. Works across buffers.
    m{              Move to the previous bookmark having the same type as the bookmark under
                    the cursor. Works across buffers.
    dm=             Delete the bookmark under the cursor.

Mappings can be controlled via the `setup` function, by passing in a mappings
table, with commands as keys, and the desired mappings as values.

The following are the available keys of the mapping table (see above as well):

  set_next               Set the next available alphabetical mark
  set                    Set a named mark (will wait for input).
  toggle                 Toggle a mark at the cursor.
  next                   Move to the next mark
  prev                   Move to the previous mark.
  delete                 Delete a mark (will wait for input).
  delete_line            Delete the marks on the current line.
  delete_buf             Delete all marks in the buffer.
  preview                Preview a mark.

  set_bookmark[0-9]      Sets a bookmark from group[0-9].
  delete_bookmark[0-9]   Deletes all bookmarks from group[0-9].
  toggle_bookmark[0-9]   Toggles a bookmark from group[0-9].
  delete_bookmark        Deletes the bookmark under the cursor.
  next_bookmark          Moves to the next bookmark having the same type as the
                         bookmark under the cursor.
  prev_bookmark          Moves to the previous bookmark having the same type as the
                         bookmark under the cursor.
  next_bookmark[0-9]     Moves to the next bookmark of of the same group type. Works by
                         first going according to line number, and then according to buffer
                         number.
  prev_bookmark[0-9]     Moves to the previous bookmark of of the same group type. Works by
                         first going according to line number, and then according to buffer
                         number.
  annotate               Prompts the user for a virtual line annotation that is then placed
                         above the bookmark. Requires neovim 0.6+ and is not mapped by default.

  Example: >

    require'marks'.setup {
      mappings = {
        set = "n",
        delete = "dn"
      }
    }
<

  means that setting mark "a" is done by pressing "na", and deleting mark "a"
  is done by pressing "dna".

  Example: >

    require'marks'.setup {
      mappings = {
        set_next = "m."
      }
    }
<
  means that setting a mark on the current cursor is done by pressing "m."

  Mappings can be disabled by setting them to false:

  Example: >
    require'marks'.setup {
      mappings = {
        next = false,
      }
    }
<
  disables the default mappings of "m]" for next.

Alternatively, <Plug> mappings are provided by marks.nvim, allowing you
to map keybindings outside of the `setup` function.

The following <Plug> mappings are provided (see above for more details
on the functionality of each mapping):

    <Plug>(Marks-set)
    <Plug>(Marks-setnext)
    <Plug>(Marks-toggle)
    <Plug>(Marks-delete)
    <Plug>(Marks-deleteline)
    <Plug>(Marks-deletebuf)
    <Plug>(Marks-preview)
    <Plug>(Marks-next)
    <Plug>(Marks-prev)
    <Plug>(Marks-delete-bookmark)
    <Plug>(Marks-next-bookmark)
    <Plug>(Marks-prev-bookmark)
    <Plug>(Marks-set-bookmark[0-9])
    <Plug>(Marks-delete-bookmark[0-9])
    <Plug>(Marks-toggle-bookmark[0-9])
    <Plug>(Marks-next-bookmark[0-9])
    <Plug>(Marks-prev-bookmark[0-9])

  Example:

    `nmap n <Plug>(Marks-set)`

  Means that setting mark "a" is done with "na".
