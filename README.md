## Features

- view marks in the sign column
- quickly add, delete, and toggle marks
- cycle between marks
- preview marks in floating windows
- extract marks to quickfix/location list
- set bookmarks with sign/virtual text annotations for quick navigation across buffers

## Installation

I recommend you use your favorite vim plugin manager, like vim-plug, or packer.

For example, using lazy.nvim, you would add the following line to the `spec` field of setup:

```Lua
{
  "chentoast/marks.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  opts = {},
}
```
of if you are using vim-plug:

`Plug 'chentoast/marks.nvim'`

If you want to manually install, you can clone this repository, and add the path
to the cloned repo to your runtimepath: `set rtp+=/path/to/cloned/repo`.

## Setup

```lua
require'marks'.setup {
  -- whether to map keybinds or not. default true
  default_mappings = true,
  -- which builtin marks to show. default {}
  builtin_marks = { ".", "<", ">", "^" },
  -- whether movements cycle back to the beginning/end of buffer. default true
  cyclic = true,
  -- whether the shada file is updated after modifying uppercase marks. default false
  force_write_shada = false,
  -- how often (in ms) to redraw signs/recompute mark positions. 
  -- higher values will have better performance but may cause visual lag, 
  -- while lower values may cause performance penalties. default 150.
  refresh_interval = 250,
  -- sign priorities for each type of mark - builtin marks, uppercase marks, lowercase
  -- marks, and bookmarks.
  -- can be either a table with all/none of the keys, or a single number, in which case
  -- the priority applies to all marks.
  -- default 10.
  sign_priority = { lower=10, upper=15, builtin=8, bookmark=20 },
  -- disables mark tracking for specific filetypes. default {}
  excluded_filetypes = {},
  -- disables mark tracking for specific buftypes. default {}
  excluded_buftypes = {},
  -- marks.nvim allows you to configure up to 10 bookmark groups, each with its own
  -- sign/virttext. Bookmarks can be used to group together positions and quickly move
  -- across multiple buffers. default sign is '!@#$%^&*()' (from 0 to 9), and
  -- default virt_text is "".
  bookmark_0 = {
    sign = "âš‘",
    virt_text = "hello world",
    -- explicitly prompt for a virtual line annotation when setting a bookmark from this group.
    -- defaults to false.
    annotate = false,
  },
  mappings = {}
}
```

See `:help marks-setup` for all of the keys that can be passed to the setup function.

## Telescope

There is a [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) extension allowing to list marks through telescope.

To activate it you need to load the extension:
```lua
local status_ok, telescope = pcall(require, "telescope")
if not status_ok then
	return
end

telescope.load_extension("marks_nvim")
```

You can then use the extension methods to list marks instead of using the native loclist system.
You simply need to call these methods in your mappings.

```lua
require('telescope').extensions.marks_nvim.marks_list_buf(opts) --[[ List buffer marks ]]
require('telescope').extensions.marks_nvim.marks_list_all(opts) --[[ List all marks ]]
require('telescope').extensions.marks_nvim.bookmarks_list_group(1, opts) --[[ List a bookmark group marks (takes the group number as argument) ]]
require('telescope').extensions.marks_nvim.bookmarks_list_all(opts) --[[ List all bookmarks marks ]]
```

These methods will use your `path_display` telescope configuraiton to display paths.
You can also pass a specific property for one method in the `opts` table. Eg.
```lua
require('telescope').extensions.marks_nvim.marks_list_all({ path_display = 'shorten' })
```

## Mappings

The following default mappings are included:

```
    mx              Set mark x
    m,              Set the next available alphabetical (lowercase) mark
    m;              Toggle the next available mark at the current line
    dmx             Delete mark x
    dm-             Delete all marks on the current line
    dm<space>       Delete all marks in the current buffer
    m]              Move to next mark
    m[              Move to previous mark
    m:              Preview mark. This will prompt you for a specific mark to
                    preview; press <cr> to preview the next mark.
                    
    m[0-9]          Add a bookmark from bookmark group[0-9].
    dm[0-9]         Delete all bookmarks from bookmark group[0-9].
    m}              Move to the next bookmark having the same type as the bookmark under
                    the cursor. Works across buffers.
    m{              Move to the previous bookmark having the same type as the bookmark under
                    the cursor. Works across buffers.
    dm=             Delete the bookmark under the cursor.
```

Set `default_mappings = false` in the setup function if you don't want to have these mapped.

You can change the keybindings by setting the `mapping` table in the setup function:

```lua
require'marks'.setup {
  mappings = {
    set_next = "m,",
    next = "m]",
    preview = "m:",
    set_bookmark0 = "m0",
    prev = false -- pass false to disable only this default mapping
  }
}
```

The following keys are available to be passed to the mapping table:

```
  set_next               Set next available lowercase mark at cursor.
  toggle                 Toggle next available mark at cursor.
  delete_line            Deletes all marks on current line.
  delete_buf             Deletes all marks in current buffer.
  next                   Goes to next mark in buffer.
  prev                   Goes to previous mark in buffer.
  preview                Previews mark (will wait for user input). press <cr> to just preview the next mark.
  set                    Sets a letter mark (will wait for input).
  delete                 Delete a letter mark (will wait for input).

  set_bookmark[0-9]      Sets a bookmark from group[0-9].
  delete_bookmark[0-9]   Deletes all bookmarks from group[0-9].
  delete_bookmark        Deletes the bookmark under the cursor.
  next_bookmark          Moves to the next bookmark having the same type as the
                         bookmark under the cursor.
  prev_bookmark          Moves to the previous bookmark having the same type as the
                         bookmark under the cursor.
  next_bookmark[0-9]     Moves to the next bookmark of the same group type. Works by
                         first going according to line number, and then according to buffer
                         number.
  prev_bookmark[0-9]     Moves to the previous bookmark of the same group type. Works by
                         first going according to line number, and then according to buffer
                         number.
  annotate               Prompts the user for a virtual line annotation that is then placed
                         above the bookmark. Requires neovim 0.6+ and is not mapped by default.
```

marks.nvim also provides a list of `<Plug>` mappings for you, in case you want to map things via vimscript. The list of provided mappings are:

```
<Plug>(Marks-set)
<Plug>(Marks-setnext)
<Plug>(Marks-toggle)
<Plug>(Marks-delete)
<Plug>(Marks-deleteline)
<Plug>(Marks-deletebuf)
<Plug>(Marks-preview)
<Plug>(Marks-next)
<Plug>(Marks-prev)

<Plug>(Marks-delete-bookmark)
<Plug>(Marks-next-bookmark)
<Plug>(Marks-prev-bookmark)
<Plug>(Marks-set-bookmark[0-9])
<Plug>(Marks-delete-bookmark[0-9])
<Plug>(Marks-toggle-bookmark[0-9])
<Plug>(Marks-next-bookmark[0-9])
<Plug>(Marks-prev-bookmark[0-9])
```
